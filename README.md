# innovativeproject-city-game

## Milestones
1. Generate random structures:
  * Just mock it, no enough time, place them once and keep that
  * Non-interactive structs generated client-side
2. Player Character:
  * Model
  * [Optional: Any kind of animation]
3. Interactive structures:
  * Being able to build a mine/extractor on a mineral (mutagen?) field
  * [Mines transfer the mined materials into the player account (player can see owned resources in the UI)]
  * [Being able to collect a bonus one-time point]
4. UI
  * Just show basic player stats
  * [Make a context menu with focused-object-specific actions]
