## Milestones
### First Demo:
1. Generate random structures:
  * Just mock it, no enough time, place them once and keep that
  * Non-interactive structs generated client-side
2. Player Character:
  * Model
  * [Optional: Any kind of animation]
3. Interactive structures:
  * Being able to build a mine/extractor on a mineral (mutagen?) field
  * [Mines transfer the mined materials into the player account (player can see owned resources in the UI)]
  * [Being able to collect a bonus one-time point]
4. UI
  * Just show basic player stats
  * [Make a context menu with focused-object-specific actions]
  
### Second Demo:  


  1. 3 types of resources & at least 3 tiers of ores and buildings
  2. Player stats system:
   * 3 classes (names to be changed):
    * Engineer - building/updating stuff
    * Magician - support for teams/buffs
    * Warrior - taking over existing buildings
  3. Guild system - fight together:
   * Guild UI consisting of:
    * Panel inviting/removing people from the guild
    * Panel for accepting invites
    * Panel with active guild members
   NOTE: personally, I see this as a 3-category slide-out panel.. just an idea
  4. Multiplayer-structure-building system:
   * "Team takeover" button next to the "Take over" building button

  4. Guild territory system
  6. PvE fights system
